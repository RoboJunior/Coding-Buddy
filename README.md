# CodeBuddy: Multi-Agent Orchestrator with Error Resolution

CodeBuddy is a multi-agent system designed to help developers troubleshoot and resolve errors faster. It leverages an **Orchestrator-Agent** architecture with specialized agents that can extract errors from logs/screenshots and resolve them using community-driven knowledge sources like GitHub, Reddit, and StackOverflow.  

It also integrates with a dedicated **MCP server** for tool access and **Opik** for observability, ensuring full visibility into agent behaviors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run **CodeBuddy** locally:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```

### 2. Start the MCP Server

Open a dedicated terminal and run:

```bash
poetry run mcp_server
```

### 3. Set Your Google API Key

Before running any agent, ensure you export your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in each terminal session:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The free version of Gemini has usage limits, so be mindful of extended chat sessions.

### 4. Run the Agents (Each in a Separate Terminal)

**Error Extractor Agent:**

```bash
poetry run error_extractor_agent
```

**StackRedHub Agent:**

```bash
poetry run stackredhub_agent
```

**Orchestrator Agent:**

```bash
poetry run orchestrator_agent
```

### 5. Start CodeBuddy CLI

After all agents and the MCP server are running, open a new terminal and launch the CodeBuddy CLI:

```bash
poetry run coding_buddy
```

Now you're ready to enjoy chatting with CodeBuddy and debugging seamlessly!
